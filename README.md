**Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning (LSTM)**

Developed a sentiment analysis model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on textual data.

**Key Highlights:**

Implemented an LSTM-based deep learning model for text classification.

Performed data preprocessing, including tokenization, padding, and text vectorization.

Trained and evaluated the model using the IMDB dataset (50K movie reviews).

Achieved high accuracy in sentiment classification.

Utilized TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NLTK for NLP tasks.

Designed a scalable and efficient deep learning pipeline for handling long-text sequences.

**Future Enhancements:**

Implementing Bidirectional LSTMs and attention mechanisms for improved performance.

Deploying the model as a Flask/Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.

Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, LSTM, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLP
